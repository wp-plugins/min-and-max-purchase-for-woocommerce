This plugin allows you to set up minimum or maximum purchase rules for products in your store.  Purchases must meet these rules to proceed to payment.



== Description ==

The Min and Max Purchase plugin for WooCommerce gives you the ability to set up minimum and maximum purchase rules for products in your WooCommerce 1.0+ store.  Customer purchases must then meet these rules, to proceed to checkout payment.

If a purchase in your store fails a  purchase rule, an error message appears at the top of the checkout page, identifying the error situation and rule requirements.  The customer must resolve the error, before the purchase can be completed.   

Fully tested with WooCommerce 2.3+ .

= Rule type? [Min or Max]  =

*   Minimum Purchase threshhold - amount/price amount must meet or exceed the min/max amount. 
*   Maximum Purchase limit - amount/price amount must not exceed the min/max amount. 


= How does the rule choose to examine the cart? [Search Criteria]  =

*   By  Role / Membership / logged in status, for cart contents  (allows different pricing rules for customer types / logged-in role, such as wholesalers or preferred customers).


= How does the rule choose to examine the cart? [Search Criteria - Pro Plugin]  =

*   By cart contents
*   For a single product
*   For a single product's variations
*   By Product Category or Min and Max Purchase Category, and/or By Role/Membership/logged in status

=> [Min and Max Purchase Pro Plugin](http://www.varktech.com/woocommerce/min-and-max-purchase-pro-for-woocommerce/) 


= How is the rule applied to the cart search results? [Rule applied to] =
*   All : work with the total of the units/prices
*   Each : apply the rule to each product in the Rule Population
*   Any : Same as each, but limits the rule testing to the first X number of products.


= Rule Applies To Either: =
*   Units Quantity Amount
*   Price Amount


= A sample of a maximum purchase rule: =
*   If the purchaser is a Subscriber - [search criteria:Subscriber]
*   The maximum total for all purchases - [rule applied to:  all]
*   Must be less than $20. - [price amount: $20]


= Checkout Error Messaging =
At checkout, the rules are tested against the cart contents.  If products are found in error, an error message (in two possible locations) will be displayed.  The error situation must be resolved, before the customer is allowed to leave the checkout and proceed to payment. 

Error messaging css can be customized using the custom css option on the Rule Options Settings screen.  There are also currency sign options, and a comprehensive debugging mode option.


= Checkout Error Message Formats =
*   Text-based descriptive format
*   Table-based format

= Role/Membership/logged in status,  for Search Criteria - More Info =

*Role/Membership is used within Wordpress to control access and capabilities, when a role is given to a user.  Wordpress assigns certain roles by default such as Subscriber for new users or Administrator for the site's owner. Roles can also be used to associate a user with a pricing level.  Use a role management plugin like [User Role Editor](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/user-role-editor/) to establish custom roles, which you can give to a user or class of users.  Then you can associate that role with a Min and Max Purchase Rule.  So when the user logs into your site, their Role interacts with the appropriate Rule.  A rule can also check against 'not logged in' status, making the rule apply to 'all in cart'.*
